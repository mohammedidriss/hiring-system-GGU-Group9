# hiring-system-GGU-Group9

The AI-Powered Predictive Hiring & Career Intelligence System is an end-to-end platform that combines machine learning, generative AI, and hybrid cloud infrastructure to modernize how candidates are evaluated and guided. It automates resume analysis, predicts candidate–role fit, classifies individuals into meaningful career clusters, and uses a conversational AI counselor to deliver personalized recommendations, skill-gap analysis, and career development plans. The system improves accuracy and consistency in hiring and career coaching while dramatically reducing manual workload for counselors and HR teams.

Built using a hybrid cloud model (OpenShift on-prem + cloud LLMs), the solution ensures data sovereignty for sensitive personal information while accessing the best AI models from AWS, Azure, and Google. It enables institutions to scale support to thousands of candidates, offer more personalized guidance, and make data-driven decisions. Even under conservative assumptions, the system provides strong operational benefits, avoids additional staffing costs, and delivers meaningful long-term ROI.
AI-Powered Predictive Hiring & Career Intelligence System📖 OverviewThe AI-Powered Predictive Hiring & Career Intelligence System is an end-to-end platform designed to modernize candidate evaluation and career guidance. By combining traditional machine learning (XGBoost) with Generative AI (Google Gemini), the system automates resume analysis, predicts candidate-role fit, and provides personalized career coaching.Built to operate on a hybrid cloud model, the solution leverages on-premise infrastructure (OpenShift) for data sovereignty while utilizing best-in-class cloud LLMs for reasoning and interaction. This approach allows institutions to scale support to thousands of candidates while maintaining strict control over sensitive personal data.Key Value Propositions:Operational Efficiency: Dramatically reduces manual screening time for HR teams.Data-Driven Decisions: Improves hiring accuracy using predictive modeling and SHAP-based explainability.Candidate Experience: Offers 24/7 AI career counseling and mock interview practice.Strategic ROI: Proven TCO reduction through optimized hybrid cloud deployment.🏗️ Architecture Design[Placeholder: Insert your high-level architecture diagram here. Recommended components to visualize: User Interface (Gradio), Orchestration Layer, ML Engine (XGBoost/SHAP), GenAI Gateway (Gemini API), and Hybrid Infrastructure (OpenShift vs. Cloud Native services).]✨ Key Features1. Predictive Hiring Engine (course4_hiring_system_v1_4.py)Automated Resume Parsing: Extracts key skills, education, and experience from PDF resumes using OCR and LLM extraction.Candidate Fit Prediction: Utilizes a robust XGBoost Classifier to predict the probability of a candidate being hired based on historical data.Explainable AI (XAI): Integrated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to provide transparent reasons behind every prediction (e.g., "High impact: Years of Experience").Executive Dashboard: Real-time visualization of global hiring trends, demographic breakdowns, and success rates.2. GenAI Career Counselor & InterviewerRAG-Based Action Plans: Generates personalized career development plans by combining candidate data with real-time Google Search results for courses and meetups.Mock Interview Simulator: An interactive chat interface where an AI persona conducts role-specific interviews, asking follow-up questions based on the candidate's previous answers.Skill Gap Analysis: Automatically identifies weaknesses in a profile and suggests specific remediation steps.3. Advanced ROI & TCO Calculator (roi_calculator_advanced_py.py)Hybrid Cloud Comparison: Simulates costs across AWS Native, Azure Native, GCP Native, and OpenShift (ROSA/ARO/Self-Managed).Granular Cost Drivers: Accounts for:Infrastructure: Compute nodes, GPU endpoints, storage, and load balancers.AI Consumption: LLM token usage (Input/Output) and training hours.Labor Costs: Estimation of engineering teams (DevOps, Data Scientists, PMs).Visual Reports: Generates detailed Matplotlib charts and breakdown tables for financial decision-making.🛠️ Technology StackFrontend & UI: Gradio (Multi-tab interface)Machine Learning: XGBoost (Classification), Scikit-Learn (Preprocessing Pipelines)Explainability: SHAPGenerative AI: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Google GenAI API)Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, OpenPyXLVisualization: Matplotlib, PlotlyInfrastructure Logic: Custom Python simulation for Cloud vs. On-Prem pricing🚀 Installation & SetupPrerequisitesPython 3.8 or higherGoogle Cloud API Key (for Gemini LLM features)1.

💻 UsageRunning the Hiring SystemThis script launches the main application, including the candidate profile evaluation, dashboard, and mock interviewer.python course4_hiring_system_v1_4.py
Access the UI at http://localhost:7860Running the ROI CalculatorThis standalone tool allows stakeholders to estimate the financial impact of the system.python roi_calculator_advanced_py.py
Access the Calculator at http://localhost:7860📊 ROI Study HighlightsThe included ROI study (roi_calculator_advanced_py.py) demonstrates the financial viability of the platform. Key findings from the logic include:Hybrid Efficiency: While hyperscaler "Serverless" options offer low entry costs, OpenShift-based hybrid deployments become significantly more cost-effective as candidate volume exceeds 5,000/month due to predictable node pricing versus per-request metering.Labor Optimization: The calculator quantifies the reduction in manual screening labor (PMs, Recruiters) against the cost of maintaining the AI infrastructure.Token Economics: Detailed analysis of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) costs, factoring in daily query volume and token limits.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome!
